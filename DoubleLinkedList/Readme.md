# Double Linked List

- Implement a double linked list using generics.
- All the elements of the list should be of the same type
- It should have an `addToEnd` method to add elements to the end of the list
- It should have an `addToStart` method to add elements to the start of the list
- It should be possible to iterate over the list using the `for .. of`
- It should have a `.size` property that returns the number of elements in the list
- It should have an `at(n)` method that returns the value in the nth position in the list, if n is negative it should return the nth element from the end of the list
- It should have a `map(func)` method that returns a new Double Linked List applied the modifier function
- It should have a `delete(n)` method that deletes the nth element in the list and returns its value
- It should have a `concat(DoubleLinkedList)` method that returns a new double linked list by concating the current list with the one passed in the function
