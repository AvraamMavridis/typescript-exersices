A customer has contacted you because they want a program that takes an arbitrary text and replaces each word with a synonym if possible. This time around the customer actually knows what a synonym is. The customer has given you a file synonyms.txt that contains a list of synonyms. Each line in the file is of the following format:
<word to be replaced>=<word to replace with> where each occurance of the word on
the left-hand-side is to be replaced with the right-hand-side word.

Write a function that reads the given text, greates a dictionary and when is called with the passed text it replaces all the words that are replaceable.
